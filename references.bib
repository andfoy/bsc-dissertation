abstract="There is large consent that successful training of deep networks requires many thousand annotated training samples. In this paper, we present a network and training strategy that relies on the strong use of data augmentation to use the available annotated samples more efficiently. The architecture consists of a contracting path to capture context and a symmetric expanding path that enables precise localization. We show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from very few images and outperforms the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the ISBI challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks. Using the same network trained on transmitted light microscopy images (phase contrast and DIC) we won the ISBI cell tracking challenge 2015 in these categories by a large margin. Moreover, the network is fast. Segmentation of a 512x512 image takes less than a second on a recent GPU. The full implementation (based on Caffe) and the trained networks are available at                                           http://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/people/ronneber/u-net                                                          .",

	abstract = {We present a conceptually simple, flexible, and general framework for object instance segmentation. Our approach efficiently detects objects in an image while simultaneously generating a high-quality segmentation mask for each instance. The method, called Mask R-{CNN}, extends Faster R-{CNN} by adding a branch for predicting an object mask in parallel with the existing branch for bounding box recognition. Mask R-{CNN} is simple to train and adds only a small overhead to Faster R-{CNN}, running at 5 fps. Moreover, Mask R-{CNN} is easy to generalize to other tasks, e.g., allowing us to estimate human poses in the same framework. We show top results in all three tracks of the {COCO} suite of challenges, including instance segmentation, bounding-box object detection, and person keypoint detection. Without tricks, Mask R-{CNN} outperforms all existing, single-model entries on every task, including the {COCO} 2016 challenge winners. We hope our simple and effective approach will serve as a solid baseline and help ease future research in instance-level recognition. Code will be made available.},

    abstract = { We address the problem of retrieving and detecting objects based on open-vocabulary natural language queries: given a phrase describing a specific object, for example ‚Äúthe corn flakes box‚Äù, the task is to find the best match in a set of images containing candidate objects. When naming objects, humans tend to use natural language with rich semantics, including basic-level categories, fine-grained categories, and instance-level concepts such as brand names. Existing approaches to large-scale object recognition fail in this scenario, as they expect queries that map directly to a fixed set of pre-trained visual categories, for example ImageNet synset tags. We address this limitation by introducing a novel object retrieval method. Given a candidate object image, we first map it to a set of words that are likely to describe it, using several learned image-to-text projections. We also propose a method for handling open vocabularies, that is, words not contained in the training data. We then compare the natural language query to the sets of words predicted for each candidate and select the best match. Our method can combine category- and instance-level semantics in a common representation. We present extensive experimental results on several datasets using both instance-level and category-level matching and show that our approach can accurately retrieve objects based on extremely varied open-vocabulary queries. Furthermore, we show how to process queries referring to objects within scenes, using state-of-the-art adapted detectors. The source code of our approach will be publicly available together with pre-trained models at http://openvoc.berkeleyvision.org and could be directly used for robotics applications. }

Deep neural networks are usually trained with simple loss functions (e.g., softmax loss). These loss functions are appropriate for standard classification problems where the performance is measured by the overall classification accuracy. For object category segmentation, the two classes (foreground and background) are very imbalanced. The intersection-over-union ({IoU}) is usually used to measure the performance of any object category segmentation method. In this paper, we propose an approach for directly optimizing this {IoU} measure in deep neural networks. Our experimental results on two object category segmentation datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms {DNNs} trained with standard softmax loss.},
