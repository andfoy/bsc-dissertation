\newthought{I would like to acknowledge and give thanks} to Pablo in the first place, for believing in my work and helping me to reconnect with my passion for Computer Vision, Neural Nets and Deep Learning in general. I would like to thank him also for giving me the opportunity of take part of the Biomedical Computer Vision group where we admire his work and advices. Without them, I don't know what I would do with my future academic roadmap. This is also for Juan Camilo and Emilio, my partners on crime all these months on the way up of taking this project to ECCV.

On the second place, I would like to thank José Tiberio, for believing on this endeavour and giving me support with all the paperwork and formalities required at the Systems and Computing Engineering (Even when they were on the wrong schedule) and his personal advices. Also, I would like to thank him specially for giving me the opportunity of traveling to Kaiserslautern on Germany, where I did not only grew academically, but also as a person and a human being. I would like also to mention all the people that I met there and helped me to endure the winter, Klaus, Diana, Carol, Meili, Sergio, Ritu and Eda.

My thanks also go to Mario Linares, for guiding me and giving me advice on the mobile app development. Thank you for volunteering with this project and providing extra perspectives.

As this was a long process that took 4 years, I would like to thank hugely all of my closest friends that did support me throughout all this time: Camila (''Llami''), Diana (''Tostada''), Stephannie (''Tefa''), Daniella (''Hermana''), Carolina and Sergio (''Checho''). Thanks for your love, time, patience and humor.

Finally, I would like to thank my family for all their support, to my mother and all her academical advices, to my father for taking care of everyday logistics and ensuring that I was always at time. To Ale and Héctor, for giving me light during those dark nights and reminding me that I am more than my fears, insecurities and masks.
